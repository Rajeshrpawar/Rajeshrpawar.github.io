                                online diploma programs in a variety of healthcare disciplines. It is important
                                to keep in mind that while some Adv. Ddiploma programs are available entirely
                                online, others may require acquiring hands-on clinical experience, which can
                                usually be arranged in the student’s locality or completed on-campus.</p>
